# Pully
SolidWorks Pully Project from Sophomore Year Engineering Design

What?

* Recreated a pully system in SolidWorks, using GD&T.

How?

* Measured each object using calipers, then sketched an engineering drawing of each object using the ASME standard.

* Combined each part into an assembly file and created an assembly drawing. 

Results:

* Recreated a 3D model of a pully system that accurately represents its real-life look and function.
